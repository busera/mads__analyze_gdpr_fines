In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.

The most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.

For this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.

As part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation. 

The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 34 (1) GDPR and EUR 316, 800 for the breach of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR.",No,2021,608000.0,9.0,FINLAND-2021,8,8,3

ETid-950,NORWAY,6300000.0,Grindr Llc,"Art. 6 (1) GDPR, Art. 9 (1) GDPR",Insufficient legal basis for data processing,"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC EUR 6.3 million. Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. 

Under GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. 

Users had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. 


The DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. 

The DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent.",No,2021,6300000.0,9.0,NORWAY-2021,22,6,6

In the context of childcare benefit applications, tax offices had processed data on the dual nationality of applicants for several years.

However, the DPA found that the data on dual nationality of Dutch citizens would not have been necessary when assessing an application for childcare benefits.

The said data had also been processed for the purpose of combating organized fraud and for automatic classification in the authority's risk system. However, even for these purposes, the processing would not have been necessary. 

For this reason, the tax and customs administration should have deleted the data on dual nationality as early as January 2014. Nevertheless, as of May 2018, the dual citizenship data of a total of 1,4 million people were still registered in the systems of the tax and customs administration.

EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. 
The DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. 
In this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. 
Sky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.
In addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.",No,2021,3296300.0,9.0,ITALY-2021,16,6,6

A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. 
Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.",No,2021,200000.0,8.0,ITALY-2021,16,8,7

The draft primarily addresses the fact that Facebook has included details on data processing in its terms of service, thus relying on Art. 6 (1) b) rather than on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. 
Critics consider this a loophole used by Facebook to circumvent the stricter GDPR requirements of consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR.

However, the DPC emphasizes that the GDPR does not establish a hierarchy of legal bases that can be used to process personal data.

Yet, the DPC noted that Facebook failed to provide clear information about its legal basis for data processing and highlights that the information provided by Facebook is discontinuous and that users are referred to different documents and texts of the data policy and terms of service. 

The DPC concludes its draft that Facebook has thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 (1) GDPR and Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR.

A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. 

The DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people.

However, the DPA noted that the exchange of information via a social network should only allow for what is specified in the relevant terms of use. The DPA clarified that the platform is intended to enable the exchange of contact information in order to make job offers.

Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.

As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.

These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. 

After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. 

For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. 

In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation.

The computer hard drive in question was not encrypted and the program in question, which contained confidential and sensitive personal data, was not equipped with security measures.

In reviewing the case, the DPO found that Favrskov Municipality had not ensured the encryption of the hard drives of the municipality's laptops for a long period of time prior to August 12, 2020, resulting in an inadequate level of security.

On June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. 
In addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building.
In this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data.

In addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken.

The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. 

In the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. 

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. 

Based on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and
EUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.


With respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.

With regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. 

Given the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.",No,2021,225000000.0,9.0,IRELAND-2021,14,4,6

The violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts.
Deliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts.
However, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. 
In addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing.

At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.

For each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues.

The DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. 

The creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object.

Ticket inspectors were required to keep the camera on for their entire shift and were therefore able to film all passengers who passed the inspector. Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.

The DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket.

Between June 2018 and January 2020, the CNIL received several notifications of personal data breaches related to a website where several million customers regularly shop. In response, the CNIL decided to investigate the company and its subcontractor entrusted with the management of this website.

In the course of its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had been subjected to numerous waves of credential stuffing attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious person obtains lists of 'unencrypted' identifiers and passwords published on the Internet, usually after a data breach. Assuming that users frequently use the same password and username (email address) for different services, the attacker will use 'bots' to try to log in to a large number of websites.

In the course of its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had been subjected to numerous waves of credential stuffing attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious person obtains lists of 'unencrypted' identifiers and passwords published on the Internet, usually after a data breach. Assuming that users frequently use the same password and username (email address) for different services, the attacker will use 'bots' to try to log in to a large number of websites.

In May 2020, the DPA received a notification from a third party about a personal data breach involving an insurance agent acting as a processing agent for Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A. who sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized addressee by email. The document contained personal data concerning, among others, surnames, first names, residential addresses and information on the subject of the insurance policy. 
As a result, the supervisory authority asked the controller to clarify whether, regarding the sending of the electronic correspondence to an unauthorized addressee, a risk analysis on the data security of natural persons had been carried out, which is necessary to evaluate whether a data breach had occurred. Such a breach requires notification to the DPA and the individuals affected by the breach. In the letter, the supervisory authority advised the controller how to notify the breach and asked for explanations.
Despite the letter requesting explanations, the controller did not report the data breach nor did it inform the data subjects about the incident. The DPA therefore initiated administrative proceedings. Only as a result of the initiation of the procedure did the controller report the personal data breach and inform two individuals affected by the breach.",No,2020,18900.0,5.0,POLAND-2020,23,2,2

In addition, data inspections stated that it had initiated a further review of Google's practices in 2018 after it received indications that several of the results that should have been removed still appeared in search results. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis.

In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low.

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--&gt; Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",No,2020,20450000.0,9.0,UNITEDKINGDOM-2020,30,7,0

This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000).

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.

Addendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied.
