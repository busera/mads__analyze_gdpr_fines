According to the data subject, he received over 60 SMS messages within 30 days.\n","The second complaint was filed by the data subject because the controller repeatedly sent him messages containing confidential data of a third party. This concerned the login information of another customer to a company platform. On the portal, it was possible to view personal information as well as invoices, among other things. Although the data subject had informed the company of this, the incorrect mailing did not end. \n","The original fine of EUR 150,000 was reduced to EUR 90,000 due to immediate payment and admission of guilt.\n","594\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","Since 2018, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) had received a total of 191 complaints against Vodafone España, S.A.U. The data subjects complained about advertising calls and messages (e-mail and SMS) made on behalf of Vodafone España as part of marketing campaigns. The contact was made without the prior consent of the data subjects and continued even after they had exercised their right to object. Furthermore, many data subjects were contacted even though their numbers were on the Robinson list.\n","\n","The AEPD explains that aggravatingly, it took into account that Vodafone España had regularly received fines in more than 50 cases from January 2018 to February 2020, and the fact that there had been 162 complaints received by the AEPD in just under two years. \n","\n","The fine is composed as follows: EUR 4 million for a breach of Art. 28 GDPR and Art. 24 GDPR; EUR 2 million for a breach of Art. 44 GDPR; EUR 150,000 for a breach of Art. 21 LSSI; and EUR 2 million for a breach of Art. 48 (1) b) LGT, Art. 21 GDPR and Art. 23 LOPDGDD.\n","595\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Individuals and Private Associations\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined a private individual EUR 1,500.

Finally, the controller had not obtained the consents of the other tenants before putting the camera into operation.\n","596\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Finance, Insurance and Consulting\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined NBQ Technology, S.A.U. EUR 20,000. An identity thief had obtained the data of a third party without authorization and applied for a microcredit from the controller under pretence of the data subject's identity. The controller then approved the loan. Since the data processed in the course of granting the loan did not belong to the loan recipient, but to the data subject, the AEPD determined that the controller did not have a legal basis for processing the data. The processing was therefore unlawful, and a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR was affirmed. The original fine of EUR 20,000 was reduced  to EUR 12,000 due to immediate payment and acknowledgement of debt.\n","597\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Public Sector and Education\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on Certime S.A..

After her address had changed in 2018, in 2019 she received mail from the controller to her new address without having informed the controller of the adress change. In the letter, the controller informed the data subject that her driver's license would soon expire. In response to a inquiry from the data subject as to where her new contact information came from, the controller informed her that its database was regularly updated using data obtained from the Spanish transport authority DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico). As the data subject had not given consent for such processing of her data, she filed a complaint against the controller with the Spanish DPA. An investigation by the DPA revealed that the company had indeed entered into a contract with DGT. However, DGT had clarified that the purpose of the processing of contact data under the contract was to ensure the accuracy of the address when renewing a driver's license or when issuing medical reports so that it could be sent to the correct address. Nevertheless, the data subjects must request and consequently consent to such a change of address. Since these criteria were not met in the specific case, the DPA found a violation of the purpose limitation principle.\n","598\n","Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante)\n","Public Sector and Education\n","The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on Ordine degli Assistenti Sociali della Regione Lazio.

The personal data, such as name, tax number, e-mail, full CV and in some cases a copy of the identity card and health card of the data subjects, was publicly visible and could be freely downloaded.  On the website, it was also possible to download the directorate resolution that had approved the list, which included the data and information of all the directors.

The controller had not entered into a contract with Capodarco that would have governed its role as data processor in accordance with the requirements of data protection law. Thus, a proper contract for commissioned processing had not been concluded until 2019, which meant that data had been processed unlawfully for a period of about 20 years.\n","601\n","Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD)\n","Public Sector and Education\n","The Belgian DPA (APD) fined a school EUR 1,000. The controller had conducted a survey on student well-being via a smartschooling system.

Despite a positive response, she continued to receive the same SMS. The data subject then filed two complaints with the Spanish DPA against Vodafone Spain. Both times, the controller had assured that it had corrected the reason for the incorrect sending and deleted the data of the data subject.

The investigation was initiated following successive notifications by the controller regarding personal data breaches related to unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to personal data such as name, correspondence address, email and health data of the data subjects. On several occasions, documents containing personal data had been sent to the wrong recipients.

At two schools in Ålesund, teachers asked students to download the training app Strava for physical education classes. The students were then given tasks that the teachers controlled via the tracking function. According to the Norwegian DPA's investigation, this resulted in data breaches because the municipality failed to provide standard procedures for privacy-compliant app use in schools. For example, a data protection impact assessment was not carried out, although this would have been necessary in view of the potential risk to the students. In addition, adequate technical and organizational security measures had not been implemented to ensure the protection of the processing.\n","609\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Industry and Commerce\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Air Europa Lineas Aereas, SA.

Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.\n","\n","The Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.\n","\n","The decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis.

That included their names, addresses and phone numbers, as well as details about their booking. The criminals also accessed the credit card data of 283 people and managed to access the credit card's security code in 97 cases. Furthermore, they tried to get other victims' credit card details by pretending to be Booking.com employees via email or phone. Booking.com was notified of the data breach on January 13, 2019, but did not report it to the DPA until February 7, 2019.

The data subject had already been a customer of the bank in the past. At that time, he had exercised his right to erasure of his data. When he tried to open a new account with the controller, he was informed that this was not possible as his data was still blocked (due to his previous erasure request). The controller further informed the data subject that he would have to unblock the data if he wanted to open an account. For this purpose, a form was attached to the letter. The form stated that by signing it, the data subject was revoking his right to erasure and allowing his data to be used (again) by the controller. The DPA found that temporarily blocking the data, does not correspond to the right to erasure. The DPA also emphasized that deleted or blocked data may not be processed again when a new contractual relationship is entered into with the controller, even if the new processing purpose is the same as the previous one.

Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR.

EUR 2,856,169 for failing to verify that all transfers of data of recipients of promotional activities were covered by consent. Several data subjects filed complaints with the DPA against the controller because they had received unsolicited advertising to which they had never consented. In its investigation against the cotroller, the DPA found that the cotroller had in fact processed personal data for telemarketing activities that it had not collected directly but had acquired from other sources. It had not checked whether valid consents had been obtained from the advertising addressees for all transfers of the data. The controller had received lists of personal data from one company, which in turn had acquired them from two other companies. The latter companies had obtained the consent of potential customers for the telemarketing carried out by them and by third parties, but this consent did not include the transfer of customer data to the controller. In this context, the DPA emphasized that consent given by a customer to a company for third-party promotional activities cannot extend its effectiveness to subsequent transfers to other operators.\n","738\n","Norwegian Supervisory Authority (Datatilsynet)\n","Health Care\n","The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined the municipality of Moss EUR 49,200 for inadequately securing personal data. \n","In January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss.

During their shifts, the controller's employees wore clothing provided by the controller.However, the designated changing room of the store was a storage room in which large quantities of cleaning materials were stored.  Due to a lack of sufficient space in this room, the employees (mostly minors) had to change in the general employee area, which was covered by a video camera. The controller stated that they had installed the video camera for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that the interests of the mostly underage employees must also be taken in account. The controller should have tried to implement less restrictive measures. In addition, the DPA underlined that the information on video surveillance was inadequate in both the employee and customer service areas.

In the process, the DPA found some serious violations of applicable data protection regulations. Thus, the DPA identified some irregularities concerning the algorithms of the Foodinho system. In particular, the DPA found that the controller had not adequately informed employees about how the system worked and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithms used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA found violations of the principles of data minimization as well as memory limitation. For example, the systems processed drivers' data to an extent that exceeded the purpose of the processing and, in some cases, stored the data significantly longer than necessary. In addition, the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure secure data processing. The controller had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the considerable amount of data of different types relating to a significant number of data subjects. Separate proceedings are being conducted against the parent company GlovoApp23 by the Spanish DPA (AEPD).\n","744\n","Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","The Finnish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 8,500 on a magazine publisher.

The subscriber to the magazine was required to accept the terms of the subscription and contract, which included consent to direct marketing. If the consent to direct marketing was not given, the magazine could not be subscribed. The DPA states that the consent and the way it was obtained did not comply with the GDPR. Indeed, the consent was not specifically requested for direct marketing and the consent collected together with the subscription and contract terms did not constitute voluntary consent for the purpose of direct marketing. \n","\n","In addition, it was not possible for data subjects to exercise their right to object due to the fact that the direct marketing calls were made using automated calling systems and the voice bots could not understand specific questions from data subjects about their data. \n","\n","Furthermore, the magazine publisher had commissioned a call center to carry out the advertising campaign and had not regulated its processing activities in a contract on commissioned processing.\n","745\n","Croatian Data Protection Authority (azop)\n","Industry and Commerce\n","A Croatian IT company provides IT services to entities such as mobile operators, banks and state institutions in Croatia, as well as to companies abroad (USA, Great Britain, the Netherlands, etc.), thereby acting as a data processor in relation to personal data. The data controller, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, informed the DPA as well its users of the potential breach of personal data by the IT provider. The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment. In its decision, the DPA took into account the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should be to support other entities through opinions and guidelines, proposing solutions for the implementation of web applications, and especially designing and implementing appropriate technical measures.\n","746\n","Danish Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet)\n","Employment\n","The Danish DPA ( Datatilsynet) has imposed a fine of EUR 53,800 on Nordbornholms Byggeforretning Aps. \n","\n","In 2018, the DPA was contacted by a data subject who complained that his former employer Nordbornholms Byggeforretning ApS, had disclosed information about him to the company's customers.\n","\n","The controller had emailed two of the company's customers informing them that the former employee had committed crimes in the course of employment and had admitted to committing them, as well as describing in detail the alleged course of events. \n","\n","According to the DPA, the controller in such a case had a \n","legitimate interest in disclosing information about the former employee's dismissal to its customers and in informing the customers that, as a result, the employee could not enter into any contracts on behalf of the company.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.\n","The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. \n","Furthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form.

A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. \n","\n","The DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.\n","\n","Furthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people. The institute should have provided the residents with a pre-recorded audio message that could be played back if necessary.\n","875\n","Data Protection Authority of Ireland\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","The organization 'None of your business' (NOYB) published a draft decision of the Irish DPA (DPC) on October 13, 2021, which indicates that it proposes a fine between EUR 28 million and EUR 36 million against Facebook.\n","\n","The draft primarily addresses the fact that Facebook has included details on data processing in its terms of service, thus relying on Art. 6 (1) b) rather than on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. \n","Critics consider this a loophole used by Facebook to circumvent the stricter GDPR requirements of consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR.\n","\n","However, the DPC emphasizes that the GDPR does not establish a hierarchy of legal bases that can be used to process personal data.\n","\n","Yet, the DPC noted that Facebook failed to provide clear information about its legal basis for data processing and highlights that the information provided by Facebook is discontinuous and that users are referred to different documents and texts of the data policy and terms of service. \n","\n","The DPC concludes its draft that Facebook has thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 (1) GDPR and Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR.\n","\n","The draft decision will now be forwarded to other European data protection authorities allowing them to comment on it.\n","876\n","Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante)\n","Public Sector and Education\n","The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 200,000 on Bocconi University. A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. \n","Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.\n","877\n","Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante)\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Sky Italia S.r.l.

Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. \n","Sky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.\n","In addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. \n","In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.\n","878\n","Norwegian Supervisory Authority (Datatilsynet)\n","Public Sector and Education\n","The Norwegian DPA has fined Østre Toten municipality EUR 412,000.

It turned out that correspondence sent by the bank through a courier service containing personal data such as first name, last name, PESEL number, home address, account numbers and identification numbers of customers, had been lost. In this regard, the UODO found that the bank had failed to report the incident to the DPA and provide adequate notice to the data subjects.\n","902\n","Dutch Supervisory Authority for Data Protection (AP)\n","Transportation and Energy\n","The Dutch DPA has fined airline Transavia EUR 400,000. \n","In 2019, the airline suffered a data breach, in which a hacker gained access to Transavia's systems through two accounts held by the company's IT department. This could have potentially allowed the hacker to access data such as names, dates of birth, gender, email addresses, phone numbers, flight information and booking numbers of 25 million passengers. It was found that the hacker actually downloaded the personal data of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf. The DPA noted that a lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the systems. Thus, it was possible to access the airline's systems simply by entering the password. The systems did not incorporate multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the access rights of the accounts were not limited to necessary systems, allowing the hacker to use them to gain access to multiple Transavia systems. The DPA found that Transavia had breached its duty to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects.\n","903\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Industry and Commerce\n","Usage of CCTV camera without proper information.\n","904\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Individuals and Private Associations\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 1,000 on a private individual for the unauthorized installation of a video surveillance camera on their car. The car had been parked on a public street, and therefore the camera was also recording public space. The AEPD found that video surveillance of public space represented a violation of the principle of data minimization.\n","905\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine on Vodafone España SAU. A data subject had filed a complaint with the AEPD against the data controller. The data subject states that he had received invoices and debits on his bank account for the payment of Vodafone services that he had not booked himself. The data subject also stated that he had been asked to pay for these services by the debt collection company I.S.G.F. Informes Comerciales, S.L.. As it turned out, fraudsters had used the data subject's personal data to conclude a service contract. Vodafone had subsequently canceled the contract for the booked services. Due to a system error, however, the outstanding invoices had not been canceled, which is why they had been forwarded to the collection agency. The AEPD determined that this transmission was unlawful due to the non-existence of a valid contract. The original fine of EUR 50,000 was reduced to EUR 30,000 due to voluntary payment and admission of guilt.\n","906\n","Bulgarian Commission for Personal Data Protection (KZLD)\n","Finance, Insurance and Consulting\n","The Bulgarian DPA has fined a bank EUR 380 for the unlawful transfer of personal data to third parties.\n","907\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Art. 13 GDPR\n","lin\n","908\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine on Vodafone España SAU.

The billing address listed in the text messages corresponded to that of an old house where the data subject had lived with his ex-partner in the past. Vodafone stated that a system error had led to this incident. This resulted in the data subject appearing as the holder of his former partner's customer account. The original fine of EUR 50,000 was reduced to EUR 40,000 due to voluntary payment.\n","909\n","Cypriot Data Protection Commissioner\n","Industry and Commerce\n","The Cypriot DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 925,000 on WS WiSpear Systems Ltd. \n","The company had collected various data from individuals (Media Access Control addresses and International Mobile Subscriber Identity data) without their knowledge as part of tests and presentations of technologies. In this context, the DPA found a violation of the principle of legality, objectivity and transparency.\n","910\n","French Data Protection Authority (CNIL)\n","Transportation and Energy\n","The French DPA (CNIL) imposed a fine of EUR 400,000 on RATP (the operator of the public transport system in Paris). In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data. For this reason, CNIL concluded that RATP failed in its duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.\n","911\n","Spanish Data Protection Authority (aepd)\n","Not assigned\n","The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 3,000 on a company.
