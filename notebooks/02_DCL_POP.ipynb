Data Collection\n"," - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n"," - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n"," - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n"," - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n","\n","### B. Data Storage\n"," - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n"," - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n"," - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n","\n","### C. Analysis\n"," - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n"," - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n"," - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n"," - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n"," - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n","\n","### D. Modeling\n"," - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n"," - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n"," - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n"," - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n"," - [ ] **D.5 Communicate bias**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n","\n","### E. Deployment\n"," - [ ] **E.1 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n"," - [ ] **E.2 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n"," - [ ] **E.3 Concept drift**: Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?\n"," - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n","\n","*Data Science Ethics Checklist generated with [deon](http://deon.drivendata.org).*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uZms1pauBzw0"},"source":["# Setup Environment"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":266,"status":"ok","timestamp":1642164896791,"user":{"displayName":"Andre Buser","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjbdkNIikqKf2FjnhCAT-v2s1dfTnuawPBTjTbj=s64","userId":"00341307039402961414"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"T_XOR4m1fXCM","outputId":"5edbf76b-8f2c-4b02-d4de-2fe5ec09a447"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Python 3.9.7\n"]}],"source":["!python --version"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FSazCCmDbqKg"},"source":["## Install Modules"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eHTRXD66bqKg"},"source":["List !pip install commands for modules which are not part of the Google Colabs standard environment.
